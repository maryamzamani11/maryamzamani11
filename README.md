My name is Maryam Zamani, a data scientist and physicist at the Berlin Institute for the foundation of Learning and Data (BIFOLD) and in the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science. 
I got my PhD in condensed matter physics from Shahid Beheshti University in Tehran, Iran. 
After my PhD, I worked as a Postdoctoral researcher in the Hungarian Academy of Science, and worked on hierarchical complex networks and introduced a model for increasing the efficiency and performance of the interactions between individuals in an organization as well as emergence of hierarchical structure in the complex networks. 
In 2019, I joined Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems in Dresden, Germany and worked mostly with time series analysis of stock prices, climate time series, and continued to work on complex networks analysis. 
I am passionate about working with different types of data and discovering the underlying pattern and structure in them. 
I am so interested in modelling different physical and economical processes with statistical physics tools.
